# **CERTIFICATE CLOUD PRACTITIONER**
## **DOMAIN 3: Cloud Technology and Services**
## **3.1 Define methods of deploying and operating in the AWS Cloud**

### Methods of Deploying & Operating
* **AWS Management Console:** Graphical interface (GUI).
* **AWS CLI (Command Line Interface):** API access via commands.
* **SDKs (Software Development Kits):** Programmatic API access (in code).
* **IaC (Infrastructure as Code):** Deploy via code (e.g., **CloudFormation**).

### Deployment Models
* **Cloud Native:** Fully in AWS.
* **Hybrid Environment:** Connects **on-premises data center** with AWS.

### Cloud Types
* **Public Cloud:** Available to the public (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google).
* **Multi-Cloud:** Using **more than one** public cloud.
* **Private Cloud:** Dedicated services (on-premises) meeting cloud criteria (e.g., **AWS Outposts**).
* **Hybrid Cloud:** Using **Public Cloud** + **Private Cloud** together.

### AWS Public vs. Private Services
* **Public Service:**
    * **Network:** Sits in the **AWS Public Zone**.
    * **Access:** Connects from the public internet.
    * **Example:** **Amazon S3**.
* **Private Service:**
    * **Network:** Sits in the **AWS Private Zone** (e.g., **Amazon VPC**).
    * **Access:** Isolated by default; no direct internet connection.
    * **Example:** **Amazon EC2** (by default).

### Connectivity Options
* **Public Internet:** Standard way to connect.
* **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Secure connection over the internet.
* **AWS Direct Connect:** **Private, dedicated connection** to AWS.
* **Internet Gateway:** Allows communication between instances in a VPC and the public internet.
